## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Secure User Authentication:** Registration and login system to ensure private and secure access for users.  
- **Intuitive Video Upload:** Simple interface for users to upload traffic videos directly from their local machine.  
- **Advanced Speed Estimation:** Uses deep learning models and computer vision techniques (like optical flow and object tracking) to detect vehicles and calculate speeds with high precision.  
- **High Accuracy:** Achieves a low average speed detection error of approximately ¬±7 km/h.  
- **Scalable & Real-Time Ready:** Supports real-time traffic monitoring, anomaly detection, and vehicle re-identification.  
- **Responsive Frontend:** Clean and modern interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

### 1. Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+  
- MySQL Server  
- Git  

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name
3. Create a Virtual Environment
macOS/Linux:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Windows:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
4. Install Dependencies
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
5. Database Setup
Log in to MySQL and create a database:

sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE vehicle_speed_db;
Import table structures from your .sql file or run Flask migrations if configured.

6. Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory:

env
Copy code
# Flask Configuration
SECRET_KEY='a_very_secret_and_random_key'
FLASK_ENV=development

# Database Configuration
DB_HOST='localhost'
DB_USER='your_mysql_username'
DB_PASSWORD='your_mysql_password'
DB_NAME='vehicle_speed_db'
7. Run the Application
bash
Copy code
flask run
Access the application at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

üöÄ How to Use
Navigate to the application URL in your browser.

Register for a new account.

Login with your credentials.

Go to the dashboard or "Upload" page.

Upload a traffic video file (.mp4, .avi, etc.).

The system will process the video and display the speed detection results.
